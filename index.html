    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- Article. We could use <p> tag also.  -->
    <article>Ever since I can remember, I've been interested in technology.

        I started my career as a legal counselor at a high-growth Silicon Valley startup doing mostly FinTech Ops. After teaching myself to code, I discovered the magic of making a web app do something with just codes, I found a lifelong passion. Eventually, I switched my career to a Ruby on Rails developer.
        
        For 1 year, I have been experienced in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. As a self-taught and self-motivated developer, I'm fully open to sharing my knowledge and learning new things with&for you. Please do not hesitate to contact me via LinkedIn and ask me anything you want!
        
        On the other hand, youâ€™re most likely to run into me at my work desk with my cold brew coffee. :)
        
        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being with my family and doing martial arts like Muay-Thai and Kick Boxing.</article>
